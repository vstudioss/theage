== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is the widget displaying the wrong moon sign? =
First of all, the plugin display the moon sign, not the sun sign which is the one that astrology web site usually talk about. Calculations for the moon sign are done for the northern hemisphere in local time, so you may see differences with other websites as some of them display the moon sign calculated in universal time (GMT). For example, Joe’s Web Tools server is in Los Angeles and display the correct calculations for pacific standard time (GMT-8).

= Is the plugin compatible with versions of WordPress ealier to 2.8? =
No. Because of the new widget implementation, you need to use WordPress 2.8 or later. If you are using an earlier version of WordPress, you can try using Moon Phases version 2.2.1 but, really, you should upgrade.
